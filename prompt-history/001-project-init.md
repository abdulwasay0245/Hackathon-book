# Prompt History: Project Initialization

**Date**: 2025-12-17
**Purpose**: Initial project setup and alignment with "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book.

## Summary
Initialized the repository context, updated the constitution to reflect the "Physical AI" and "Digital Twin First" approach, and set up the documentation structure.

## Reasoning
- **Constitution Update**: The original constitution was generic. Updated to explicitly prioritize the book (documentation-driven) and simulation (Digital Twin) to ensure all code serves the educational purpose of the project.
- **Template Updates**: Modified `spec-template`, `plan-template`, and `tasks-template` to include book module alignment and simulation verification steps, enforcing the "Sim-to-Real" workflow.
- **Docusaurus Setup**: Established a Docusaurus project to host the book content, structured by the four key modules (Nervous System, Digital Twin, Brain, VLA).
