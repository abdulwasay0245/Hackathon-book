# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics through AI Agents

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the book **"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics through AI Agents"**.

This documentation serves as the living technical companion to the book, structured into four key modules designed to guide you from the nervous system of a robot to its high-level cognitive vision-language-action capabilities.

## Modules

- **[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./01-nervous-system/intro)**  
  Middleware and low-level control for humanoid robots.

- **[Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](./02-digital-twin/intro)**  
  Physics simulation, environment design, and sim-to-real verification.

- **[Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)](./03-ai-brain/intro)**  
  Perception, navigation, and reinforcement learning.

- **[Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./04-vla/intro)**  
  Integrating Large Language Models with robotics for high-level reasoning.
